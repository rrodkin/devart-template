To overstate the obvious, I’m getting a late start here, having only found out about the competition two days ago.  After some mild internal debate, I’ve decided to just go for it.  Many are espousing creative coding as a “new” art, but as with many new things, it’s been around for a while.  Like, since the 60’s.  Really.

But on to the project . . 

**Background**

As I mentioned in the description, I’d been working on an interactive version of John Whitney’s **Matrix III**.  If you haven’t seen it, and you’re even mildly interested in computer-generated art, [this is a must see](http://youtu.be/ZrKgyY5aDvA).

In the first segment, which lasts under two minutes, Whitney presents us with four sets of six white discs, which he proceeds to shuffle about the screen in what may initially seem like a chaotic fashion.  Just the opposite.  He is actually moving the discs along a spline (e.g. a track), and in a very precise way.

It took me a while to figure what the path was exactly, but after sketching and resketching (see below), it became apparent that the path consisted of a Lissajous curve.

Since time is of the essence — even beyond the 3/28 deadline, as July is not that far off — we need to clearly define scope, so here’s a brief rundown.
