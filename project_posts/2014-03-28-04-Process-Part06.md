#Process - Part 06: Finale

##All My Codebase Are Belong To You

I’ve just gone through and tidied up the code a bit, and implemented the feature allowing users to switch between spline types.  Given the time constraint, I’ll admit that I went for the less-risky-though-not-so-elegant solution, and rather than switch splines within a single scene, I’ve just duped the scene eight times and switch scenes (e.g. levels) via key commands.  It’s seamless and works very well.

I’m about to upload the prototype, and once that’s done, time permitting, I’ll add a final video.

Still have one more post to do as well, regarding projected plans for the installation itself.
